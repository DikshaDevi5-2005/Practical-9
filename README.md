# Practical 9 - Multi-Vendor Collaboration Using Git
In this practical, one main repository is used as the original source (upstream). 
Two more repositories (VendorA and VendorB) are connected to it. 
All three repositories can share updates with each other. 
Each vendor can make changes in their own branch and update their copy without affecting others.
## Key Concepts
 Connecting multiple Git repositories
 Creating and switching branches
 Sharing changes using commit and pull
 Keeping all repositories updated
 Avoiding conflicts while updating
## Steps Done
1. The main repository (upstream) was used.
2. Two new vendor repositories (VendorA and VendorB) were created.
3. Both vendor repositories were added as remotes in the main project.
4. A new branch was created to make changes.
5. The changes were shared with vendor repositories.
## Result
All repositories are connected and can share updates easily. 
This helps in managing code when different vendors are working on the same project.
