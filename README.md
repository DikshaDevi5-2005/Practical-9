# Practical-9
This task uses three Git repositories: upstream, vendorA, and vendorB. All repositories are linked by adding them as remotes. A patch is made in upstream and copied to vendorA and vendorB using git cherry-pick. The patch is then removed from vendor B using git revert. A patch log is kept to show where the patch exists, making tracking easier.
